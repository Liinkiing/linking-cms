# Linking CMS
A CMS made in Symfony 3.
For testing purposes.

What you can do :

* Create a page
* Create a blog post
* Manage users
* Define per-users roles
* Login system / Register

Not intended for real situations. I'm just learning how to use Symfony and Github. But it can be used as testing, it's working, and
it's usable.
